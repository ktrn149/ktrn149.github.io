		<h4>New Start, New Career</h4>
			</p>So why web development?  Several reasons...firstly, it's going to be in demand for a while.  Everyone and their kid brother has an internet connection of some kind, and professionals are needed to either create websites, manage media and information, or to build applications that people can use on mobile devices.  In addition, it's a career in which one can enter without a formal education (case in point: me!) and can potentially work in any location around the world.  Even though I've used the internet for well on 15 years now, this is the first time I've attempted to make it my profession.  As such, I know that it's going to be a long and challenging journey.</p>

		<h4>Korea: Going Back to my Second Home</h4>
			<p>I have a strong affection for the country and people of Korea.  After living there for three years, I've become a big fan of the country.  The history, culture, cuisine, langauge of Korea has been a never-ending source of interest for me.  To this day, there's a lot I still haven't done or seen in South Korea.</p>
			<p>My goals for going back to Korea:</p>
			<p>1. Contiune to learn about and experence Korea, and educate students in learning English</p>
			<p>2. Save a sizeable portion of my income (>80%) to put towards my education in computer science</p>
			<p>3. Use the next 2-3 years as a launching platform to enter the web development industry.  I recognize that it will take time to study and create projects, so I want to use my time abroad effectively</p>

		<h4>My Interests</h4>
		<p>Besides what I already mentioned, I like trying new food, exercising (wait, that's a lie...dang it), visiting new places, hanging out and meeting friends at a bar or coffee shop, watching sports, and saving money (seriously, I'm becoming a bit of a financal maniac!).  Also, I'm a sports nut.  Here are three of my favorite sports teams:</p>
