		<h4>New Start, New Career</h4>
			</p>So why computer science?  Several reasons...firstly, it's going to be in demand for a while.  Everyone and their kid brother has a computer, and professionals are needed to either create websites, software, or applications that people can use on a multitude of devices.  In addition, it's a career in which one can potentially enter without a formal education, and have many career and work location options.  Even though I've used computers since I was a kid, this is the first time I've taken seriously as a profession.  I know that it's going to be a long and challenging journey, but I'm excited to learn and slowly make progress.</p>

		<h4>Korea: Going Back to my Second Home</h4>
			<p>I have a strong affection for the country and people of Korea.  After living there for three years, I've become a big fan of the country.  The history, culture, cuisine, langauge of Korea has been a never-ending source of interest for me.  To this day, there's a lot I still haven't done or seen in South Korea.</p>
			<p>My goals for living in Korea:</p>
			<p>1. Contiune to learn about and experence Korea, and educate students in learning English</p>
			<p>2. Save a sizeable portion of my income to put towards future endevors in computer science</p>
			<p>3. Use the next 2-3 years as a launching platform to enter the tech industry.  I recognize that it will take time to study and create projects, so I want to use my time abroad effectively</p>

		<h4>My Interests</h4>
		<p>Besides what I already mentioned, I like trying new food, exercising (wait, that's a lie...dang it), visiting new places, being a homebody, and learning about early retirement (the website that got it all started is <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/" target="_blank">Mr. Money Mustache</a>.  Also, I'm a bit of a sports nut.</p>
